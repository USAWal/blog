Blog application
================

Description
-----------

This blog application is yet another blog implementation. I was requested to do this as a homework assignment. Inspired by this challenge and equipped with Ruby technologies I've created this code.

Constraints
-----------

* Latest version of Ruby and Rails. ( The latest stable versions of Ruby was 2.2.0, and RoR framework was v4.2.0)
* Erb rather than HAML (Despite I find it cumbersome I used it, but actually I preffer using Slim or HAML that are concise and expressive)
* R-Spec rather than Test::Unit
* Postgres rather than MySQL
* Semantic, accessible HTML5
* CoffeeScript rather than JavaScript
* Sass rather then CSS
